Rename file extensions and can add numbers to the end of a file name in a directory using python

This is a Python script with a graphical user interface built using the tkinter library. The purpose of this script is to rename all files with a specified file extension in a selected directory to a new file extension. The user selects the directory using a file explorer dialog, enters the old extension and new extension into text boxes, and has the option to add a number to the end of the file name using a checkbox and number entry field. Once the user has entered all the necessary information and clicks the "Run" button, the script renames all files with the old extension to the new extension in the specified directory. If the checkbox for adding a number is selected, the script adds the number to the end of the file name. The user is notified with a message box when the script has completed the renaming process.

##How to use:

Download the uwu.py file from the GitHub repository.

Install Python on your computer if it is not already installed. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install the required Python modules by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal: pip install tk.

Double-click on the uwu.py file to open the graphical user interface.

Click the "Select Directory" button to choose the directory containing the files you want to rename.

Enter the current extension of the files in the "Enter current extension" field. For example, if the files you want to rename have the extension ".txt", enter "txt" (without the quotes).

Enter the new extension you want to give to the files in the "Enter new extension" field. For example, if you want to rename the files with the extension ".txt" to ".doc", enter "doc" (without the quotes).

If you want to add a number to the end of the file name, check the "Add number to the end of file name" box and enter the starting number in the "Enter Number if applicable" field.

Click the "Rename Files" button to rename the files in the selected directory.

Once the files have been renamed, a message will appear indicating that the process was successful.

You can then check the directory to confirm that the files have been renamed according to your specifications.
