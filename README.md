Rename a bunch of photo files and add "2" at the end of each name using Python, you can use the following script.

Make sure to replace "PATH" with the actual path to the folder containing your photo files. This script will rename all of the files in the specified folder by adding "2" at the end of each name. Note that this script will overwrite any existing files with the same name, so be sure to use it with caution.
